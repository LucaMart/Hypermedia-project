Cose che rimangono da sistemare: 

Assistance Service - Fiber (FAQ, Related Products)

Link al video per i testimonial
 
servirebbe uno script che specifichi che tutti i link che non sono SamsungGalaxyS7, TIMVision, etc. devono apparire
di colore nero, cosÃ¬ si distinguono i link validi e quelli no.


#Userful informations

We used Jquery( also ajax), Bootstrap for some pages.

We made pages dynamically generated by the javascript, so that it is easy to add new content by adding the proper rows in the database. This makes all of ours links clickable, even if there is no content for the related page (caused by the fact that filling the database with all the content will take a lot of time).
Here is the list of the Topic pages full of content:

Assistance services:
    >Smartlife--->Tim Vision--->Discover Tim Vision
Devices:
    >Smartphones and phones--->Samsung Galaxy S7
    >TV and SmartLiving---> Samsung Smart TV 50
SmartLife services:
    >TV&Entertainment---->Tim Vision
Who we are

The other pages can have some content, but are not full.
