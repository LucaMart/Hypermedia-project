#Useful informations

UI Frameworks: we used Bootstrap for some pages.
We used the jQuery library in our Javascript.

Our pages are dynamically generated using javascript, so that it is easy to add new content by adding the proper rows in the database. This makes all of our links clickable, even if there is no content for the related page (caused by the fact that filling the database with all the content would take a lot of time).
Here is the list of the Topic pages that we implemented:

Assistance services:
    >Smartlife--->Tim Vision--->Discover Tim Vision
Devices:
    >Smartphones and phones--->Samsung Galaxy S7
    >TV and SmartLiving---> Samsung Smart TV 50
SmartLife services:
    >TV&Entertainment---->Tim Vision
    >Home---->Tim Tag
Who we are: Innovation, Projects, Testimonials

Other topic pages may have some content, but are not fully implemented.
